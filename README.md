# nodejs_wedding_website

This project is used to deploy a node js web application to handle a wedding website.
The website will dinamycally load the gallery image, so that everyone will be able to upload photos to the website with a simple ssh connection through.
This is done to help a less tech savvy person to modify the gallery withouth the need to restart the application.

Also the web application handle the possibility of a participation list with the use of JSON files.
A database hasn't been used as the number of participants is going to be a small defined number, and a database would be considered overkill.

Also There's a plan in the future to integrate the web app with a twitter bot, so that the website will be able to fetch tweets received on a specific hashtag or a specific twitter profile.
